# Configuration for OGC Building Blocks dedicated to EOAP CWL Custom Types
# Based on Earth Observation Application Package schemas

name: EOAP CWL Custom Types Building Blocks

abstract: |
  Building Blocks for CWL Custom Types used in Earth Observation Application Packages (EOAP).
  These types enable mapping between CWL workflow inputs/outputs and OGC API Processes descriptions.

description: |
  The custom types provide a standardized way to describe:
  - GeoJSON geometries and features for spatial inputs/outputs
  - STAC Catalogs, Collections, and Items for EO data manifests
  - OGC bounding boxes for spatial extents
  - Standard string formats (datetime, URI, email, etc.)
  
  These types bridge the gap between CWL workflow specifications and OGC API Processes
  processDescription schemas, enabling automatic mapping of inputs and outputs as described
  in Table 13 of OGC API - Processes Part 1: Core ([OGC 18-062r3](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-062r3.html)).
  
  **Note**: These building blocks document CWL Custom Types defined in [eoap/schemas](https://github.com/eoap/schemas). 
  The JSON Schemas provided are translations for documentation purposes. CWL uses Schema Salad as its schema 
  language, which is based on Apache Avro Schema and extends it with semantic annotations for linked data.
